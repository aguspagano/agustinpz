Hello!

This is Agustin, 

Versatile, process and customer satisfaction oriented industrial engineer. 
Born in Buenos Aires city; raised in Ushuaia; professionally made in Cordoba. 

Currently living in Buenos Aires, making my way into the IT world. 

Always eager to learn more and find new horizons. Getting experience from Agile methodologies and Full Stack Web development (JavaScript, React, Redux, Ajax, WebAPI's, PostgreSQL, Node JS, Express, Sequelize).

As a student I had the opportunity to work in big corporations, such as Coca-Cola and Techint, where I experienced using TQM, 5S and Kaizen tools.

My biggest passion is skiing. It has always been present in my life, training and racing as a youngster, teaching it since the age of 18, and also as my first big bet as an entrepreneur developing a custom ski and snowboard building company from scratch, mainly working with Lean Manufacturing principles.

For the last year I have worked in the systems field as a Project Leader for the University of Buenos Aires, implementing a centralized information system at the University libraries, which improved my workflow standards, team leading and communication skills.

I consider myself as an All-Terrain Project Leader and love being challenged everyday.

I'm open to work, please feel free to reach me out.
